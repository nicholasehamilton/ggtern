ggtern 1.0.6.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Replaced the padding argument of the coord_tern constructor, with an insertion of rows and columns around the main panel in the rendering routine, with an associated theme element 'panel.margin.tern', which is distinct from and not to be confused with 'plot.margin' or 'panel.margin'
* Better logic in determining the major and minor breaks in the event that the user does not specify explicitly
* Fixed a bug in the Confidence Levels, when inf values where being generaged in the isometric log ratio calculation.
* Alterations to the theme_custom constructors, for consistency with the theme element names
* Alterations / typos fixed in documentation

ggtern 1.0.6.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed bug in the rendering of coordinates axes, when not using any breaks or labels for the top axis
* Greately improved placement, padding and margin logic and use of grid
* Revised and greatly improved manual clippiing procedure for data outside the ternary surface
* Added theme_novar_tern function, many thanks to John Szumiloski
* Added geom_polygon_tern, and used it within geom_confidence and geom_density_tern
* Added the (heavily requested) contoured smoothing geometry, geom_interpolate_tern
* Fixed some documentation issues

ggtern 1.0.5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Added convenience function theme_custom() to allow the user to control basic theme colours very easily
* Added geom_line() to the list of approved geometries.
* Fixed 'abuse of donttest' as required by CRAN

ggtern 1.0.4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES
* Fixed broken dependency between ggplot2 0.9.3.2 and ggplot 1.0.0 from find_global internal function

ggtern 1.0.3.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Added convenience functions, and global options for modifying the length of the ternary arrows easily.
* Added function for putting points in sequence for path plotting, see ?point.in.sequence

BUG FIXES
* Fixed broken ggsave function, which was not using the local print function.
* Fixed geom_errorbarR reference in geom_errorbarT and geom_errorbarL aesthetic check.
* Fixed some missing export functions in NAMESPACE file
* axis.tern.arrowstart and axis.tern.arrowfinish can now take vectors

ggtern 1.0.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Fixed broken patch in geom_density2d()

ggtern 1.0.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Grid rendered AFTER border
* Documentation Improvements
* Inclusion of USDA Soil Classification Data, accessed by: data(USDA)
* Creation of New geometries for ternary errorbars, ie, geom_errorbarT, geom_errorbarL and geom_errorbarR
* Creation of convenience functions (theme_showtitles and theme_hidetitles) for hiding or showing the apex titles
* Creation of convenience functions (theme_showlabels and theme_hidelabels) for hiding or showing the axis ticklabels
* Better handling of convenience functions for hiding (and showing which is new) major or minor gridlines
* Improvement on arrow positioning relative to ticks and axis labels.
* Convenience function for the setting of the ternary arrow baseline (theme_arrowbaseline(value))
* Removal of grid elements for existing axes (ie not just using blank elements)
* Creation of theme_minimal, equivalent to the ggplot2 version.
* Creation of theme_classic, equivalent to the ggplot2 version.
* Creation of Multiplot function, for arranging multiple plots.
* Changed the default mapping T=y, L=x and R=z, since it is likely that people new to ternary plots will find this more intuitive, created global options so this can be modified.
* Modified logic so that T, L and R ALWAYS relate to the Top, Left and Right apex, regardless of assignment in coord_tern(...).

BUG FIXES
* Labels not assigning correctly when coord_tern() not using default x,y,z mapping.
* Error in geom_confidence wrt clockwise (existing dependency on ternary.options)

ggtern 1.0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Ordering of grid rendering was changed relative to the remaining background items

* Global tern.clockwise option was created

* Changed default procession from anticlockwise to clockwise

* Theme nomleclature has been made more like the ggplot2 nomleclature, in the sense that
  ORIGINAL                SUPERCEDED BY             ALIASES
  theme_tern_bw()         -> theme_bw()
  theme_tern_gray()       -> theme_gray()           theme_grey()
  theme_tern_rgbg()       -> theme_rgbg()           theme_rgb()
  theme_tern_rgbw()       -> theme_rgbw()

* Theme nomleclature improved for some unique ternary functions.
  ORIGINAL                SUPERCEDED BY             ALIASES
  theme_tern_nogrid_major -> theme_nogrid_major()   tern_nogrid_major()
  theme_tern_nogrid_minor -> theme_nogrid_minor()   tern_nogrid_minor()
  theme_tern_nogrid       -> theme_nogrid()         tern_nogrid()

* Better Documentation for Theme Convenience Functions
  

* In the above themes, they have furthermore been slightly changed to be more consistent
  with that of ggplot2, in terms of the minor and major colors for the default theme_gray.

* Error protocols for version control implemented, same as ggplot2, however, for ggtern.

* New theme elements option for putting ticks INSIDE or OUTSIDE of the axis, OUTSIDE is default. 
  Convenience functions also created theme_ticksoutside() and theme_ticksinside()

* Clockwise/Anticlockwise axis precession is now controlled by the theme element 'axis.tern.clockwise', as a 'logical'.

* Length of theme elements in 'units', such as major and minor ticks.

* element_ternary fully depreciated in favour of individual theme elements.

* Added functionality for 'secondary ticks' and convenience functions theme_showsecondary(), theme_hidesecondary(), theme_showprimary(), theme_hideprimary()

BUG FIXES

* Correction to logic in .theme_new internal function

* Correction to theme_nogrid(), so that it could be 'added' to other themes.

* Correction to theme element logic when switching between printing of ggplot2 and ggtern objects.

* Ticks rendered after grid, previously it was the other way around, 
  obvious since inside ticks have been introduced.

* last_coord set to NULL during onLoad, originally it was set to coord_tern(), which was necessary for the default theme elements, however, 
  is presumptuous in terms of what te user will actually plot.

* Correction of padding by aspect ratio, which was introducing small errrors in ticks, noticiable for long tick sizes.

* Restructured cood_tern() and how it renderd the ternary elements, distinct functions were broken off from the main render_bg routine.

* Correction to throwing points in geom_smooth set, when coordinate limits != c(0,1)

* .theme_nocart(), which destroys all cartesian theme elements, is now applied EVERY TIME a ggtern object is rendered. Previously, if a new theme (say theme_bw()) is applied to an EXISTING ggtern plot (ie plot + theme_bw()), some cartesian theme elements were creeping back into the plot.

ggtern 1.0.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Package accepted for CRAN

BUG FIXES

* Coordinate system was not working as expected when theme_clockwise()
  was used.
